#To-Do List Project

This is a small practice project focused on web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project involves creating a To-Do List where users can add tasks, mark them as done, and remove them as needed.

Features:
Add Tasks: Users can easily add tasks to the list by typing them into the input field and pressing enter.
Mark as Done: Completed tasks can be marked as done by clicking on them, which visually distinguishes them from the rest of the tasks.
Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking on a delete button associated with each task.
